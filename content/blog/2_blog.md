### Set up your platform from start to finish

Now this is not final, but it is a way of documenting the process that i am going through.


Steps

1. First create a git repository on github.com, with the name of your blog. Technically the repo name can be any
but i suggest to keep the repo name and the site name same, for obvious cleanliness. In my case it is 'Shiva'

2. I am going to use 'Hugo' framework with the 'PaperMod' theme. Main reason to use these - speed,
efficency, customizability

3. 
```bash
hugo new site <site-name> -f yml
```
hugo new site shiva -f yml

cd shiva
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/shivajreddy/shiva.git
git push -u origin main

we follow the module 2 which is git submodule /Users/smbp/.Trash/content

git submodule

### Extra Tips ✅

### 1. Keep the engine running 🏎️
Now that all the metal was casted and the workflow set up to a good level for you to get started. We should focus on keep this car running. If you are anything like me, I love starting new things, which is why i jump in to try every new fancy that's out there (it's the child in me 👶🏽). But for having a successfull blog/platform for you to share your ideas Use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as your markdown editor.
