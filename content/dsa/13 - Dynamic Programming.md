Learning objectives:

Understand the difference b/w Greedy method and Dynamic programming.
1. Greedy Method: 
Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm for finding Minimum Spanning Tree is a Greedy Method. In this method, we don't explore all the variations, we find the most optimum solution. because when we start with a node, we look for another node that has the least edge weight with current node.
- Takes less space and time.
2. Dynamic Programming:
- Takes more space and time. More time because we explore all possibilities.
  More space because in Top-Down approach we use memoization which stores all possible variations, hence more space.
