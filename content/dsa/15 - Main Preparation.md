#### Algorithm Preparation: 
For every algorithm that I learn, i want the algorithm to be in my muscle memory.
Example: Take binary search, i should solve couple of binary search problems. Then on white board write the outline of the algorithm, and then erase, write the outline again, and again, and again, for a total of 10 times minimum. Now this algorithm is not in muscle memory yet. After writing 10 times on the board, in the algorithms folder create a new file for this particular algorithm and write this outline, but also with detailed explanations in every step of the way. Because by the time i finish writing 10 times and solving couple of problems using this algorithm, i know the key aspects of the algorithm: in this example, when moving the left or right pointer, moving them to the correct location, and when calculation the mid index value don't simple use mid = l+r /2 since l+r can go out of bounds. So all the nuances and tiny details should be written on the algorithm file.
Now you are 80% there, after a week, come back to this algorithm again, start with whiteboard outlining the algorithm, and then write on the white board itself the key aspects of this algorithm, now open the algorithm file and compare. Then re-solve the same 5 problems that you did last week with this algorithm. Then 100% its in your muscle memory.
